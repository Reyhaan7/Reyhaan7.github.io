#  A Bad Start!

It's already been few weeks since the course started. I couldn't be in the class the first three sessions. 
Just before the new semester starts, I received the worst news ever. My nightmare happened. I lost one of the dearest people of my life. It was the worst peiod of my life. It was the worst start I could possibly have into the new semester.
Put the drama aside .… the start of the semester didn't go well either. I had to stay in my country to be with the family for a couple of weeks. So I missed the fisrt few sessions of this class which is the most technical course of my master program. And boy it sucks not to be there! especially the beginnig! The start is the most important part! If you start strong, you go on strong! If you start confused, well it's gonna suck! I'm still confused afters some weeks I can tell you that! But let's see what happens! I'm gonna put more time on this and see if things get more clear. Sure it is hard. We loose people … We loose people we love … But life goes on. I have to pull myself together. I can't stay confuse and disappointed of myself the whole semester! _life goes on_.
